This is a slightly improved version of the Tidypics plugin for Elgg 1.8.

ATTENTION:

CURRENTLY STILL IN BETA!!!

I would advice you to use the flash uploader on productive sites only after thorough testing. If in doubt, use the basic uploader. With Beta6 I made some improvements in the flash uploader (upgraded to version 3.2 of the Uploadify flash uploader) compared to the original Tidypics version but there might still some bugs included. Addtionally, the flash uploader has some limitations (due to limitations of Uploadify), so I might decide to switch to another flash uploader (most likely with html5 support) in future releases.



Known issues:

- flash uploader might not be free of errors,
- watermarking not fully tested / not fully working,
- slightshow not yet fully tested,
- tagging is not yet feature complete (as compared to pre-Elgg 1.8, e.g. tagging users) and what is implemented might still not fully work.



Installation and configuration:

IMPORTANT: If you have a previous version of the tidypics plugin installed then disable the plugin on your site and remove the tidypics folder from the mod folder on your server before installing the new version!
1. copy the tidypics plugin folder into the mod folder on your server,
2. enable the plugin in the admin section of your site,
3. configure the plugin settings. Especially, check if there's an "Upgrade" button visible on the Tidypics plugin settings page and if yes, execute the upgrade.



Changelog:

Changes for release 1.8.1beta7 (by iionly):
 - auto-correction of image orientation on image upload (thanks to Jimmy Coder for the code snippet for image rotation),
 - word tags (as opposed to tagging a user): tags that don't correspond with a username will be added to the tags of the photo (searchable),
 - Includes the following changes in Tidypics from official Tidypics repo at https://github.com/cash/Tidypics:
    * set tiny size for sites that may not have it set (e.g. possibly sites updated from Elgg 1.6) (by Cash Costello),
    * stripping non word characters from title when pulled from image filename (by Cash Costello),
    * added tagging to river with notification to user (by Cash Costello, Kevin Jardine).


Changes for release 1.8.1beta6 (by iionly):
 - Fix for Tidypics to work in Elgg 1.8.15 (creating new albums),
 - Updated uploadify flash uploader to version 3.2 (this might only be a preliminary solution as I might need to switch to another flash (html5) uploader as the Uploadify uploader has some limitations and also seems no longer fully supported),
 - Fixed some deprecated function calls (they were not in actively used code but some people might have wondered about it nonetheless as the Code Analyzer plugin gave some warnings about them),
 - Fixed html code in widgets' content.php for better theme compatibility (as suggested by ura soul).


Changes for release 1.8.1beta5 (by iionly):

- Fix in river entry creation (hopefully last fix necessary for now...).


Changes for release 1.8.1beta4 (by iionly):

- River entries code reworked (solution introduced in beta3 did not work as intended),
- Option to include preview images in river entries when comments were made on albums and images,
- Fix a few errors in language files (en and de),
- Permission handling of tidypics_batches: on permission change of an album the permissions of corresponding tidypics_batches are changed to same new permission.


Changes for release 1.8.1beta3 (by iionly):

- River entries fixed (note: commenting on existing "batch" river entries does not work. It will only work for river entries created after upgrading to 1.8.1beta3!)


Changes for release 1.8.1beta2 (by iionly):

- Fixed quota support,
- Fixed issue with image entries (without images available) getting created on failed image uploads,
- Fixed an issue introduced in beta1 that resulted in (harmless but many) log entries getting created,
- Fixed Highest vote counts page,
- Display of Elggx Fivestar rating widget defined via Elggx Fivestar default view (requires version 1.8.3 of Elggx Fivestar plugin).


Changes for release 1.8.1beta1 (by iionly):

- removal of option to set access level for images. Images always get the same access level as the album they are uploaded to. On changing the access level of an album all its images get assigned the same access level, too.
- new plugin navigation / pages: more centered on (recent) images than albums,
- support of Widget Manager index page and groups' pages widgets,
- Elggx Fivestar voting widget included on detailed image views,
- some code-cleanup.
